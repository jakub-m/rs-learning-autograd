# Automatic gradient in Rust

My learning exercise to understand automatic gradient, and to exercise Rust.

## Materials

- [What is Automatic Differentiation?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG_nF1awSSY)
- [Demystifying AutoGrad in Machine Learning](https://medium.com/@weidagang/demystifying-autograd-in-machine-learning-eb7d5c875ff2)

## Possible TODOs

- Implement reverse mode.
- In forward mode, use single hash map.
- Make the computation generic w.r.t F, e.g. use f64 or use vectors.
